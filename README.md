# ML-Meanfield
In this project, I will be using Orbital charges and corresponding mean-field energy levels as features to predict quasi-particle energy levels.
I will be using III-V semiconductor materials with zincblend phase for the training ant testing purpose. For mean-field energy levels and orbital charges I
will be using DFT base code Quantum Espresso (https://www.quantum-espresso.org/) and for Quasi-particle energy levels I will be using MBPT based code (https://berkeleygw.org/)
